# Migration Log

- 2025-10-10T13:16:30+00:00: Phase 0 initialized; repository prep artifacts created.
- 2025-10-10T13:23:27+00:00: Phase 1 started; merged FlowTime-Sim mainline history into working tree (conflicts pending resolution).
- 2025-10-10T13:38:47+00:00: Re-merged using FlowTime-Sim time-travel head commit to capture current changes (conflicts pending resolution).
- 2025-10-10T15:19:30Z: Added `FlowTime.Integration.Tests` project with initial Sim→Engine compatibility coverage; full solution test run (`dotnet test FlowTime.sln`) passing with planned skips noted in REPO-CONSOLIDATION-PLAN.
- 2025-10-10T15:30:25Z: Runtime smoke validation completed; Engine `/v1/healthz` returned healthy payload, Sim `/v1/healthz` responded healthy. Both processes launched via `dotnet run` and shut down cleanly.
- 2025-10-10T15:32:12Z: README now carries the consolidation notice section outlining Sim project locations, unified commands, and Phase 5 docs follow-up.
