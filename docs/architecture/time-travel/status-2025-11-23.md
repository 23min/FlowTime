# FlowTime Time-Travel Status — 2025-11-23

## Executive Snapshot
- Core Time-Travel APIs, telemetry capture/bundle pipeline, and CLI orchestration remain in production use (no regressions since the 2025-10-16 audit).
- All canonical templates now include backlog-aware queues and explicit DLQ/terminal sinks on “our” services, matching TT‑M‑03.32.1 goals.
- Analyzer/Sim validation swept the template catalog; full solution tests pass (aside from documented performance/Sim skips).
- Remaining gaps center on the ecosystem: template discovery endpoints, topology layout hints, and the planned TelemetryLoader service.

## Highlights Since 2025-10-16
1. **Template retrofits complete**: IT microservices, manufacturing line, network reliability, incident workflow, transportation, and supply-chain templates now drive DLQs only from operator-owned services and model backlog carry/attrition realistically. Release notes and milestone docs updated; FlowTime.Sim + TemplateBundle tests cover the new behavior.
2. **DLQ lens documented**: Milestone doc explicitly documents the “our services vs. dependencies” rule, and the release notes point to the template changes. Deferred analyzer enhancements (queue-arrivals vs upstream served) are tracked for the next epic.
3. **Build/test hygiene**: `dotnet build` + `dotnet test FlowTime.sln` pass end-to-end; the previous API test timeouts are resolved after the Processor rename fix.

## Outstanding Gaps / Deferred Items
| Gap | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Template discovery/catalog | No `/v1/templates` endpoint or catalog metadata for UI discovery. `/v1/runs` filtering works, but template metadata is still static. | Needs API/CLI support; referenced in status-2025-10-16.md and roadmap docs. |
| Topology layout hints | Templates still omit `topology.ui` hints; UI uses heuristics. | Provide deterministic layout rules or embed positions in templates to stabilize graphs. |
| TelemetryLoader component | Architecture docs (Ch.3–Ch.5, planning roadmap) assume a dedicated TelemetryLoader service (ADX/KQL ingest). Implementation deferred; current tooling relies on CLI capture/bundles. | Should be re-scoped into a future milestone; no runtime loader exists yet. |
| Analyzer cross-node checks | Analyzer doesn’t cross-check queue arrivals vs upstream `served`. This allowed mistakes like `queue_demand` semantics. | Deferred to next epic—requires topology-aware validation or edge-level telemetry. |

## Action Items (Carryover)
1. Define and implement a template discovery endpoint/catalog API so UI can enumerate templates with metadata.
2. Document or emit topology layout metadata to stabilize graph rendering.
3. Plan the TelemetryLoader backlog item (or update the architecture docs to reflect the CLI-based pipeline).
4. Design analyzer enhancements for queue-arrival cross-checks once the above items are scheduled.
