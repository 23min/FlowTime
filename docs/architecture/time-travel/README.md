# Time-Travel Architecture Docs

This directory groups the design and planning documents for FlowTime's time-travel capability.

- `time-travel-architecture-ch*.md` — six KISS architecture chapters covering principles, contracts, components, data flows, implementation roadmap, and decision log.
- `time-travel-planning-*.md` — the Gold-First planning artifacts (decisions and roadmap) that translate the KISS architecture into the M3.x delivery plan.

Use these docs together: start with the architecture chapters for system context, then consult the planning files for milestone scope and execution details.
