## Charter Vision Summary

FlowTime transforms from simulation demo tool to **model authoring platform** with **artifacts-centric workflow**:

```
[Models] â†’ [Runs] â†’ [Artifacts] â†’ [Learn] â†’ [Compare]
    â†‘         â†‘         â†‘           â†‘         â†‘
    â”‚         â”‚         â”‚           â”‚         â”‚
 Author    Execute   Persist     Analyze   Compare
 models    models   results    patterns  scenarios
```

### **Core Charter Principles**
1. **Never Forget**: Persistent artifacts registry remembers all work
2. **Artifacts-Centric**: Everything flows through artifacts (runs, models, telemetry)
3. **Contextual Actions**: Compare, Export, Analyze launched from artifacts/results
4. **Input Selection â†’ Configure â†’ Compute â†’ Results**: Unified workflow pattern

## Charter Implementation Strategy

### **Incremental Migration Approach**
The charter transition uses **incremental migration** to preserve user workflows while introducing charter concepts:

#### **Phase 1: Foundation (M-02.07)**
- Add artifacts registry backend with API
- Auto-create run artifacts from existing runs
- Preserve all existing UI and workflows
- **User Impact:** None - registry operates transparently

#### **Phase 2: Charter Navigation (M-02.08 + UI-M-02.08)**
- **Backend (M-02.08):** Registry integration APIs and enhanced service architecture
- **Frontend (UI-M-02.08):** Charter tabs alongside existing UI with navigation patterns
- **Integration:** Artifacts registry browsing through UI components consuming M-02.08 APIs
- **User Impact:** New capabilities, existing workflows unchanged

#### **Phase 3: Charter Actions (M-02.09 + UI-M-02.09)**
- **Backend (M-02.09):** Compare infrastructure and contextual action APIs
- **Frontend (UI-M-02.09):** Compare interfaces integrated into charter workflow
- **Integration:** Charter actions consume M-02.09 infrastructure through UI-M-02.09 components
- **User Impact:** Complete charter workflow with comparison capabilities
- **User Impact:** Enhanced capabilities via contextual actions

#### **Phase 4: Full Charter (M-03.x)**
- Primary workflows use charter patterns
- Existing UI becomes legacy/power-user mode
- Charter workflow optimization and polish
- **User Impact:** Streamlined charter-native experience

### **Risk Mitigation Strategy**

#### **No Functionality Regression**
- Existing export, templates, analysis remain fully functional
- Charter features added alongside, not replacing existing features
- Users can ignore charter features and continue existing workflows

#### **Gradual User Adoption**
- Charter features are additive enhancements
- No forced migration to charter workflow
- Natural adoption as users discover charter benefits (persistent artifacts, Compare)

#### **Technical Continuity**
- Charter implementation builds on M-02.06 infrastructure
- Service patterns and API integration carry forward
- Performance and reliability maintained throughout transition
