**Vision:** Transform FlowTime into a comprehensive **model authoring and analysis platform** with artifacts-centric workflow  
**Status:** Charter Implementation Revised (UI-M2.8 Phase 2+ Postponed)  
**Last Updated:** January 27, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

FlowTime is evolving from a simulation demonstration tool into a **professional model authoring platform** that enables engineers to create, execute, persist, and compare probabilistic models at scale. The platform follows an **artifacts-centric paradigm** where all work is preserved and discoverable through persistent registry.

### **Charter Workflow Paradigm**
```
[Models] ‚Üí [Runs] ‚Üí [Artifacts] ‚Üí [Learn] ‚Üí [Compare]
    ‚Üë         ‚Üë         ‚Üë           ‚Üë         ‚Üë
    ‚îÇ         ‚îÇ         ‚îÇ           ‚îÇ         ‚îÇ
 Author    Execute   Persist     Analyze   Compare
 models    models   results    patterns  scenarios
```

### **Key Principles**
- **Never Forget**: Persistent artifacts registry remembers all work
- **Artifacts-Centric**: Everything flows through artifacts (runs, models, telemetry, comparisons)
- **Contextual Actions**: Compare, Export, Analyze launched from artifacts and results
- **Unified Workflow**: Input Selection ‚Üí Configure ‚Üí Compute ‚Üí Results pattern across all features

## Historical Context: The M2.6 Charter Transition

### **Pre-Charter Era (M0-M2.5)**
**Characteristics:** Demo-focused development with individual feature milestones
- **M0-M1:** Core engine and basic UI implementation
- **M2.0-M2.5:** Individual features (templates, analysis pipeline, UI components)
- **Approach:** Feature-driven development without unified workflow vision

### **Charter Transition (M2.6)**
**Catalyst:** Recognition that FlowTime needed transformation from demo tool to professional platform  
**Key Insight:** Users needed persistent workflow and artifact management, not just individual features

**M2.6 as Turning Point:**
- **Last Pre-Charter Milestone:** Completed export functionality using traditional approach
- **Charter Foundation:** Export system provided infrastructure patterns for artifact generation
- **Paradigm Shift:** Transitioned from export-focused to artifacts-centric thinking
- **Architecture Alignment:** M2.6 work preserved and enhanced to support charter vision

### **Post-Charter Era (M2.7+)**
**Characteristics:** Artifacts-centric development with unified workflow vision
- **Unified Vision:** All development aligned with charter workflow paradigm
- **User Focus:** Professional workflows that preserve and build upon all work
- **Architecture:** Separation of concerns between backend services (M2.x) and UI implementation (UI-M2.x)
