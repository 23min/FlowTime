# FlowTime Sim Roadmap (v2.0, Harmonized with Engine ↔ UI)

> **Purpose:** Synchronized milestone plan ensuring lock-step development across Engine ↔ Sim ↔ UI with artifact-first contracts.

**Current Engine Status**: 📋 M3 (Backlog v1 + Latency) not started yet  
**Next Engine Priority**: 📋 M4 (Scenarios & Compare) or M3 - TBD  
**Retry Status**: 📋 M9.5 (Retry & Feedback) - deferred from M4.5

## Harmonized Guiding Rules

1. **Artifact-first, catalog-required**: run.json, manifest.json, series/index.json, series/*.csv; **Catalog.v1 is required** stable ID source
2. **Units & IDs locked**: flows = entities/bin, levels = entities, latency = minutes; seriesId = measure@componentId[@class]  
3. **Retry/feedback deferred**: Engine M9.5 ↔ Sim SIM-M6 (not urgent)
4. **Lock-step milestones**: Engine↔Sim parity tests required on every milestone touching artifacts

## FlowTime-Sim's Role (per Harmonized Plan)

FlowTime-Sim is the **synthetic generator companion** producing telemetry-like data ("Gold" series) with **artifact-first, catalog-required contracts**. **Critical separation of concerns:**

- **✅ FlowTime-Sim Responsibilities:**
  - Generate synthetic telemetry when real telemetry unavailable
  - Produce Gold series validating Engine features at each milestone
  - Create training/calibration data for parameter learners  
  - Support deterministic replay with seeded stochastic draws
  - **Maintain Catalog.v1 as required stable ID source**

- **❌ FlowTime-Sim DOES NOT:**
  - Implement Engine's expression language (SHIFT, CONV, MIN, MAX, etc.)
  - Evaluate DAG models or perform flow analysis
  - Replace Engine's analytical capabilities
  - Provide real-time flow processing or decision making

**Schema Compatibility**: Identical artifact schemas and API contracts between Engine and Sim. **Units & IDs locked**: flows = entities/bin, levels = entities, latency = minutes; seriesId = measure@componentId[@class].

## Lock-Step Milestone Alignment

### SIM-M3 — Backlog v1 + Latency + Artifact Endpoints — **🔄 PRIORITY**

- **Goal** Generate basic queues and latency for Engine M3, consolidating queuing basics.
- **Why** Engine M3 (Backlog v1 + Latency) pulled forward. Basic queues only - later M7 = Backlog v2 (buffers & spill).
- **Engine Status** 📋 M3 not started yet, SIM-M3 ready when needed  
- **Supports** Engine M3 (Backlog v1 + Latency + Artifact Endpoints)
- **Core Features** 
  - **backlog[t] = max(0, backlog[t-1] + inflow[t] − served[t])**
  - **latency[t] = served[t]==0 ? 0 : backlog[t]/served[t]*binMinutes**
  - **Emit series/backlog.csv, series/latency.csv**
  - **Basic generator**: arrivals, served, capacity, backlog derived identically to Engine's formula
  - **No retry echoes** (deferred to SIM-M6)
- **CLI**
  ```
  flow-sim gen basic --config basic-config.yaml --out runs/backlog-v1 --seed 42
  # Basic queues for Engine M3 development
  ```
- **Acceptance** 
  - Engine M3 processes FlowTime-Sim artifacts without errors

## Cross-Cutting Contract & Process Gates

### Required for Every Milestone

1. **Catalog.v1 is required**: remove all "optional" language - both Engine & Sim require catalog
2. **Series ID/units are normative**: any change must bump schema version
3. **Engine↔Sim parity tests are required gates**: on every milestone that touches artifacts
4. **UI consumes artifacts only**: no bespoke payloads

### Always-on Acceptance Gates

- **Determinism:** same spec + seed ⇒ identical artifacts (hash-stable)
- **Schema guard:** reject unknown top-level scenario keys unless `x-…`
- **Time alignment:** all timestamps divisible by `binMinutes`
- **Contracts parity:** CLI and Service write **identical artifacts**
- **Catalog join test:** bijection between `Catalog.components[].id` and Gold `component_id`
- **Unit parity:** Engine's adapters consume Sim pack with no overrides
- **Schema compatibility:** FlowTime-Sim artifacts validate against Engine without modification
- **Integration validation:** Each phase demonstrates actual Engine compatibility before advancement
