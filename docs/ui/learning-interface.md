# FlowTime Learning Interface Design Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Audience:** UI designers, learning experience architects, stakeholder demo teams  
**Purpose:** Define pedagogical UI for introducing digital twin concepts, FlowTime capabilities, and stakeholder demos  

---

## 1. Mission Statement

The FlowTime Learning Interface serves as an **educational platform** that transforms complex digital twin concepts into accessible, interactive experiences. Unlike the expert interface focused on productivity, this interface prioritizes **understanding**, **engagement**, and **concept building**.

### Core Objectives:
1. **Demystify Digital Twins** - Make abstract concepts tangible through visualization
2. **Business Value Communication** - Translate technical capabilities into business impact
3. **Progressive Learning** - Guide users from basic concepts to advanced scenarios
4. **Stakeholder Engagement** - Enable compelling demos for decision makers
