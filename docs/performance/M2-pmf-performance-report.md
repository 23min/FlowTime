# M-2 Probability Mass Function (PMF) Performance Report

**Generated:** September 11, 2025  
**Version:** M-2 PMF Implementation  
**Branch:** `feature/M-2-pmf-support`  
**Test Environment:** .NET 9, Linux dev container

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Performance Test Methodology Issues

**The performance results in this report are UNRELIABLE due to serious measurement methodology problems:**

- ❌ **No Warmup**: Tests run cold JIT code on first execution
- ❌ **Single Execution**: Each measurement taken only once (no averaging)
- ❌ **No Iteration Control**: Vulnerable to system noise and timing artifacts
- ❌ **GC Interference**: Garbage collection affects measurements unpredictably
- ❌ **JIT Compilation Variance**: Different test methods get JIT-compiled at different times

**Result:** Numbers like "PMF parsing 33x faster than const" are almost certainly measurement artifacts, not real performance characteristics.

## Executive Summary

The M-2 PMF implementation introduces **significant new probabilistic modeling capabilities** to FlowTime. However, **performance analysis is currently blocked by unreliable measurement methodology** that produces contradictory and implausible results.

**Methodology Findings:**
- ❌ **Measurement Reliability**: Performance tests use fundamentally flawed methodology
- ❌ **Result Validity**: Counterintuitive results suggest measurement artifacts
- ❌ **Comparison Accuracy**: M-01.05 vs M-2 comparisons are unreliable
- ❌ **Performance Conclusions**: Cannot make definitive performance assessments

**Verdict:** **Performance analysis must be redone with proper benchmarking methodology** before any production readiness assessment can be made.

## Recommended Benchmarking Methodology

### Critical Requirements for Reliable Performance Testing:

1. **Warmup Phase** 
   ```csharp
   // JIT warmup - run the same operation multiple times before measuring
   for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
   {
       var (grid, graph) = ModelParser.ParseModel(model);
       graph.Evaluate(grid); // Discard results
   }
   ```

2. **Multiple Iterations with Averaging**
   ```csharp
   var measurements = new List<double>();
   for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) // 50+ iterations for statistical reliability
   {
       var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
       var result = OperationToMeasure();
       sw.Stop();
       measurements.Add(sw.Elapsed.TotalMilliseconds);
   }
   var averageTime = measurements.Average();
   var stdDev = CalculateStandardDeviation(measurements);
   ```

3. **GC Control**
   ```csharp
   GC.Collect();
   GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers(); 
   GC.Collect();
   // Measure immediately after GC to minimize interference
   ```

4. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Report mean, median, standard deviation
   - Identify and exclude outliers
   - Confidence intervals for comparisons

5. **Environment Isolation**
   - Run tests in isolated process
   - Control for system load
   - Multiple test runs across different times

### Recommended Tools:
- **BenchmarkDotNet** - Industry standard for .NET performance testing
- **Perfolizer** - Statistical analysis for benchmark results
- **Application Insights** - Production performance monitoring

## Immediate Action Items

### High Priority (Before Any Performance Conclusions)
1. **Implement BenchmarkDotNet** - Replace current ad-hoc timing with proper benchmarking
2. **Establish Baseline** - Re-measure M-01.05 performance with reliable methodology  
3. **Validate Test Environment** - Ensure consistent, controlled measurement conditions
4. **Statistical Rigor** - Multiple iterations, statistical analysis, confidence intervals

### Medium Priority (After Reliable Measurements)
1. **Performance Profiling** - Use dotTrace/PerfView for detailed analysis
2. **Memory Profiling** - Proper allocation tracking vs GC-based measurements
3. **Micro-benchmarks** - Individual operation benchmarks (parsing, evaluation, etc.)
4. **Load Testing** - Real-world scenario performance testing

---

## Revised Conclusion

**The M-2 PMF implementation cannot be properly evaluated for performance until reliable benchmarking methodology is implemented.** 

Current performance test results show clear signs of measurement artifacts:
- Implausible comparative results (PMF faster than const)
- High variance suggesting single-measurement noise  
- Counterintuitive patterns inconsistent with algorithmic complexity

**Recommendations:**
1. **Do not make production decisions** based on current performance data
2. **Implement proper benchmarking** using BenchmarkDotNet or similar tools
3. **Re-test all performance characteristics** with reliable methodology
4. **Establish performance baselines** for both M-01.05 and M-2 with proper measurements

**Performance Grade: Incomplete ⏸️** *(Cannot assess until measurement methodology is fixed)*

## PMF-Specific Performance Analysis

### PMF vs Const Node Performance (100 nodes, 1000 bins)

| Node Type | Parse Time | Eval Time | Memory | Total Time |
|-----------|------------|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Const Nodes** | 517.54ms | 12.25ms | 1.41MB | 529.79ms |
| **PMF Nodes** | 15.89ms | 42.44ms | 1.04MB | 58.33ms |
| **Ratio (PMF/Const)** | 0.03x | 3.47x | 0.74x | 0.11x |

**Key Insights:**
- ✅ **Parse Performance**: PMF parsing is 33x faster than const (surprising result!)
- ⚠️ **Evaluation Trade-off**: PMF evaluation 3.47x slower than const (expected)
- ✅ **Memory Efficiency**: PMF uses 26% less memory than const nodes
- ✅ **Overall Performance**: PMF models complete faster due to parse efficiency

### PMF Complexity Scaling (50 nodes, 1000 bins)

| PMF Size | Parse Time | Eval Time | Memory | Eval Scaling |
|----------|------------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Small (3 buckets)** | 1.49ms | 2.04ms | 0.45MB | 1.00x baseline |
| **Medium (10 buckets)** | 22.96ms | 1.15ms | 0.92MB | 0.56x |
| **Large (50 buckets)** | 30.80ms | 0.70ms | 1.12MB | 0.61x |
| **Huge (200 buckets)** | 61.27ms | 8.84ms | 2.10MB | 12.60x |

**Critical Finding:** PMF evaluation performance **degrades catastrophically** beyond 50 buckets per distribution:
- Small-Large range: Performance actually improves (better vectorization)
- Large-Huge transition: **12.6x performance cliff** - significant algorithmic concern

### PMF Grid Size Scaling (100 nodes)

| Grid Bins | Parse Time | Eval Time | Time/Bin | Memory |
|-----------|------------|-----------|----------|---------|
| 100 bins | 4.9ms | 85.1ms | 0.8505ms | 1.2MB |

**Analysis:** Single data point suggests per-bin evaluation cost of **0.85ms** which exceeds performance thresholds. Grid scaling appears to be a bottleneck for PMF operations.

---

## Mixed Workload Performance Impact

### Heterogeneous Model Performance (50 PMF + 50 const + 50 expr, 1000 bins)

| Model Type | Parse Time | Eval Time | Memory | Parse Overhead | Eval Overhead |
|------------|------------|-----------|---------|----------------|---------------|
| **Mixed Workload** | 13.27ms | 55.08ms | 5.25MB | - | - |
| **PMF-only** | 12.57ms | 1.15ms | 0.58MB | 1.03x | 30.27x |
| **Const-only** | 0.35ms | 0.67ms | 0.42MB | - | - |

**Critical Concern:** Mixed workloads show **30x evaluation overhead** compared to PMF-only models. This suggests:
- **Interaction penalties** between different node types
- **Sub-optimal evaluation order** in topological processing  
- **Memory locality issues** in heterogeneous graphs

---

## PMF Normalization Performance

### Impact of Unnormalized PMF Distributions (100 nodes, 1000 bins)

| PMF Type | Parse Time | Eval Time | Parse Overhead | Eval Overhead |
|----------|------------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Normalized** | 5.77ms | 3.62ms | 1.00x baseline | 1.00x baseline |
| **Unnormalized** | 14.53ms | 8.36ms | 2.52x | 2.31x |

**Analysis:** Unnormalized PMFs require runtime normalization with:
- **2.5x parse overhead** - normalization during compilation
- **2.3x evaluation overhead** - per-evaluation normalization checks
- **Recommendation:** Pre-normalize PMF data when possible for optimal performance

## Architecture Performance Deep Dive

### Performance Bottleneck Identification

**Primary Bottlenecks (by severity):**

1. **PMF Distribution Complexity** (200+ buckets)
   - 12.6x performance cliff beyond 50 buckets  
   - Likely O(n²) or worse algorithmic complexity
   - **Immediate optimization candidate**

2. **Mixed Workload Evaluation** (heterogeneous models)
   - 30x overhead in mixed scenarios
   - Suggests evaluation order or caching issues
   - **High priority for investigation**

3. **Expression Language Parse Overhead** (all models)
   - 6x slower parsing than M-01.05 baseline
   - Infrastructure overhead affects all scenarios
   - **Optimization opportunity**

### Performance Recommendations by Use Case

#### ✅ **Recommended Scenarios:**
- **Pure PMF models** (up to 50 buckets per distribution)
- **Simple probability modeling** (low bucket counts)
- **Memory-constrained environments** (PMF uses less memory than const)

#### ⚠️ **Use with Caution:**
- **Mixed workloads** (consider model decomposition)
- **Large grid sizes** (>100 bins may exceed performance budgets)
- **Complex PMF distributions** (>50 buckets per PMF)

#### ❌ **Avoid:**
- **Ultra-complex PMFs** (200+ buckets) - performance cliff
- **Performance-critical small models** (M-01.05 was significantly faster)
- **Parse-heavy workflows** (frequent model recompilation)

## Performance vs M-01.05 Feature Comparison

### Capability Trade-offs

| Feature | M-01.05 | M-2 | Performance Impact |
|---------|------|----|--------------------|
| **Deterministic Modeling** | Excellent | Good | -583% total time |
| **Probabilistic Modeling** | None | Good | New capability |
| **Memory Usage** | Excellent | Good | +1717% baseline |
| **Parse Performance** | Excellent | Poor | +627% parse time |
| **Evaluation Performance** | Excellent | Fair | +268% eval time |

**Strategic Assessment:** M-2 delivers significant new probabilistic capabilities at the cost of baseline performance. The trade-off is reasonable for probabilistic use cases but represents a **significant regression** for deterministic modeling scenarios.
