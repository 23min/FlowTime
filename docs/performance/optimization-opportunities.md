# Performance Optimization Opportunities

## Overview

This document outlines potential performance optimizations for FlowTime, focusing on evaluation/computation performance where the most significant impact can be achieved. While parsing performance has optimization opportunities, evaluation performance is more critical since models are parsed once but evaluated many times across different scenarios and time ranges.

## Current Performance Baseline

Based on M1.6 benchmarking results:
- **Small models** (10 nodes): ~52Œºs evaluation, ~18Œºs parsing
- **Medium models** (100 nodes): ~976Œºs evaluation, ~250Œºs parsing  
- **Large models** (1000 nodes): ~67ms evaluation, ~23ms parsing

**Key insight**: Both parsing and evaluation show O(n¬≤) scaling characteristics, but evaluation dominates runtime in practical usage patterns.

## High-Impact Optimization Areas

### 1. Memory Allocation Patterns (üçé Low Hanging Fruit)

**Current Issue**: Excessive allocations (21MB for 1000-node models) trigger frequent GC cycles
- Gen0: 4,000 collections per 1,000 operations
- Gen1: 2,286 collections per 1,000 operations  
- Gen2: 571 collections per 1,000 operations

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse `double[]` arrays for time series data
- **ArrayPool<T>**: Use .NET's built-in array pooling for temporary allocations
- **Span<T>/Memory<T>**: Replace array allocations with stack-allocated spans where possible
- **Pre-allocation**: Size collections appropriately to avoid resize operations

**Expected Impact**: 50-70% memory reduction, 20-30% evaluation performance improvement

### 2. Expression Evaluation Efficiency (üçé Low Hanging Fruit)

**Current Issue**: Expression trees are interpreted rather than compiled
- Repeated function lookups for operators (MIN, MAX, SHIFT)
- Boxing/unboxing for arithmetic operations
- String-based node lookups in evaluation context

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- **Expression Compilation**: Compile expression trees to delegates using `System.Linq.Expressions`
- **Operator Caching**: Pre-resolve function implementations during parsing
- **Node ID Mapping**: Replace string-based lookups with integer indices
- **Vectorization**: Use SIMD operations for element-wise array operations

**Expected Impact**: 40-60% evaluation performance improvement

### 3. Lazy Evaluation Strategies (üçé Low Hanging Fruit)

**Current Issue**: All nodes evaluated regardless of output requirements
- Entire graph processed even for partial output requests
- No memoization of intermediate results
- Redundant calculations in complex expressions

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- **Demand-Driven Evaluation**: Only evaluate nodes required for requested outputs
- **Result Caching**: Memoize evaluation results for identical inputs
- **Incremental Updates**: Cache and reuse results when only subset of inputs change
- **Dependency Pruning**: Skip evaluation branches not affecting final outputs

**Expected Impact**: 30-80% performance improvement depending on output selectivity

### 4. Parallel Evaluation (üå≥ Medium Complexity)

**Current Issue**: Sequential evaluation despite independent node computations
- Topological ordering prevents obvious parallelization
- No exploitation of multi-core capabilities
- CPU underutilization in large models

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- **Level-Based Parallelism**: Evaluate independent nodes at same topological level in parallel
- **Work Stealing**: Dynamic load balancing across CPU cores
- **PLINQ Integration**: Parallelize array operations within node evaluations
- **Task-Based Evaluation**: Asynchronous evaluation with dependency coordination

**Expected Impact**: 2-4x performance improvement on multi-core systems

### 5. Algorithmic Improvements (üå≥ Medium Complexity)

**Current Issue**: Inefficient algorithms for core operations
- O(n¬≤) parsing complexity
- Inefficient topological sorting
- Suboptimal expression tree structures

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- **Incremental Parsing**: Parse model deltas rather than full re-parsing
- **Optimized Graph Algorithms**: More efficient topological sorting and cycle detection
- **Expression Optimization**: Constant folding, common subexpression elimination
- **Compressed Representations**: Reduce memory footprint of parsed models

**Expected Impact**: Addresses scaling bottlenecks, enables larger model support
