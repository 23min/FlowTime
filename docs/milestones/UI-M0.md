# UI Milestone UI-M0

## Scenarios

- See the numbers: Plot CSV outputs from a run to validate intuition and explain results.
- Example: Visualize demand vs served from the M0 example.

## How it works

- Minimal SPA (Blazor WASM) page that can load a CSV and show a simple line chart.
- Data source can be a local file or a dev API; the UI is read‑only at this stage.

## Why it’s useful now

- Visual validation builds trust and accelerates adoption.
- Helps catch modeling mistakes early.
