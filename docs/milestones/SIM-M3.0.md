# Milestone SIM-M3.0 â€” FlowTime-Sim Charter Alignment

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Planned (Charter-Aligned)  
**Dependencies:** SIM-M2.7 (Registry Preparation), SIM-M2.8 (Model Authoring Service & API), SIM-M2.9 (Compare Integration), Engine M2.7 (Artifacts Registry), Engine M2.9 (Compare Infrastructure)  
**Target:** FlowTime-Sim as model authoring platform feeding charter ecosystem  
**Date:** 2025-10-01

---

## Goal

Transform **FlowTime-Sim** from demonstration tool to **model authoring platform** that creates and validates model artifacts for the FlowTime-Engine charter ecosystem. This milestone establishes FlowTime-Sim as the primary path for creating model artifacts that flow seamlessly into the [Models] â†’ [Runs] â†’ [Artifacts] â†’ [Learn] charter workflow.

## Context & Charter Alignment

The **FlowTime-Engine Charter** positions model artifacts as the **input to the ecosystem**, but doesn't specify how models are created. FlowTime-Sim becomes the **model authoring platform**:

- **Model Creation**: Catalog-based model authoring with validation and export
- **Artifact Generation**: Models saved as artifacts compatible with charter registry
- **Integration Testing**: Sim validates models work correctly before export to engine
- **Charter Bridge**: Seamless handoff from Sim (model authoring) to Engine (execution platform)

This milestone establishes the **complete ecosystem flow**:
```
FlowTime-Sim (Create Models) â†’ FlowTime-Engine (Execute & Analyze) â†’ Compare & Learn
```

## Functional Requirements

### **FR-SIM-M3.0-1: Model Artifact Export System**

**Registry Integration Architecture:**

FlowTime-Sim integrates with Engine artifacts registry through API abstraction:

â€¢ **API-Based Access Pattern:**
  - Sim uses Engine registry REST API endpoints (no direct file system access)
  - Engine registry API abstracts file-based storage implementation
  - Clean separation between Sim (model authoring) and Engine (model execution/storage)
  - Future database migration transparent to Sim integration

â€¢ **Integration Flow:**
  ```
  FlowTime-Sim â†’ Engine Registry API â†’ File-Based Storage
       â†“                 â†“                    â†“
  Model Export    POST /v1/artifacts    Structured Files
       â†“                 â†“                    â†“
  Engine Access   Artifact Metadata     Registry Index
  ```

**Model Export Service Requirements:**

â€¢ **Core Export Functions:**
  - Export current Sim configuration as complete model artifact
  - Convert Sim catalog/scenario into FlowTime engine model (nodes and edges)
  - Validate exported model for Engine schemaVersion 1 compatibility
  - Test engine model execution before export to ensure quality
  - Bundle all assets (catalogs, scenarios, engine YAML) for transport
  - Upload model artifacts directly to Engine registry via REST API endpoints

â€¢ **Export Options:**
  - Configurable title, description, and tags for model identification
  - Adjustable time horizon and time step for engine execution
  - Selectable output series for specific analysis needs
  - Optional validation inclusion for quality assurance
  - Asset bundling control for complete or minimal exports

Enhanced FlowTime-Sim UI for charter ecosystem model authoring workflow.

### **FR-SIM-M3.0-3: Model Validation & Quality Assurance**
Comprehensive validation system ensuring exported models work correctly in Engine.
