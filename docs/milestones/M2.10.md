# M2.10 â€” Compare Workflow (Deferred)

**Status:** ðŸš« Deferred  
**Dependencies:** M2.8 (Registry Integration & API Enhancement), M2.7 (Artifacts Registry)  
**Target:** Implement charter Compare functionality using artifacts registry  
**Date:** TBD (Pending charter workflow re-evaluation)

---

## Goal

Implement the **charter's Compare workflow** that enables side-by-side analysis of any two artifacts (Run vs Run, Run vs Telemetry, Model vs Model execution). This milestone establishes the core charter UI paradigm where Compare is a **contextual action** launched from results or artifacts registry, not a separate analysis mode.

## Status: Deferred

This milestone has been **deferred pending charter workflow re-evaluation**. The Compare functionality was originally planned as part of the charter workflow paradigm, but charter navigation and workflow approaches require reimplementation with clearer user value proposition.

## Context & Charter Alignment (Original Plan)

The **FlowTime-Engine Charter** defines Compare as a core workflow:
- **Compare button** on results: Launch from current run to select comparison input
- **Compare action** on artifacts: Select baseline, choose comparison, view side-by-side results  
- **Input flexibility**: Compare Run artifacts, Telemetry artifacts, or fresh Model executions
- **Engine integration**: Engine runs/replays both inputs and produces comparison metrics

This milestone would transform comparison from "separate analysis feature" to **contextual workflow** integrated throughout the artifacts-centric UI.

## Future Considerations

When charter workflow approach is reimagined, this milestone may be:
- **Reconsidered** with updated charter paradigm
- **Simplified** to focus on basic comparison without charter integration  
- **Replaced** with alternative comparison approaches

## Dependencies Impact

- **M2.7 (Artifacts Registry)**: Still valuable for artifact storage and discovery
- **M2.8 (Registry Integration)**: Still supports enhanced API integration
- **UI-M2.7+ (Charter UI)**: Charter navigation system also deferred
