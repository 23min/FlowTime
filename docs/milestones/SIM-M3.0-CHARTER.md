# Milestone SIM-M3.0 â€” FlowTime-Sim Charter Alignment

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Planned (Charter-Aligned)  
**Dependencies:** M2.7 (Artifacts Registry), M2.9 (Compare Workflow)  
**Target:** FlowTime-Sim as model authoring platform feeding charter ecosystem  
**Date:** 2025-10-01

---

## Goal

Transform **FlowTime-Sim** from demonstration tool to **model authoring platform** that creates and validates model artifacts for the FlowTime-Engine charter ecosystem. This milestone establishes FlowTime-Sim as the primary path for creating model artifacts that flow seamlessly into the [Models] â†’ [Runs] â†’ [Artifacts] â†’ [Learn] charter workflow.

## Context & Charter Alignment

The **FlowTime-Engine Charter** positions model artifacts as the **input to the ecosystem**, but doesn't specify how models are created. FlowTime-Sim becomes the **model authoring platform**:

- **Model Creation**: Catalog-based model authoring with validation and export
- **Artifact Generation**: Models saved as artifacts compatible with charter registry
- **Integration Testing**: Sim validates models work correctly before export to engine
- **Charter Bridge**: Seamless handoff from Sim (model authoring) to Engine (execution platform)

This milestone establishes the **complete ecosystem flow**:
```
FlowTime-Sim (Create Models) â†’ FlowTime-Engine (Execute & Analyze) â†’ Compare & Learn
```
