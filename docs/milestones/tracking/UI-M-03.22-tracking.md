## Progress Log

### Session: Milestone Setup
- [x] Read milestone document
- [x] Create feature branch name
- [x] Create tracking document

**Next:** Polish docs + regression run; prep for review.

---

### Session: Layout Polish (Rectangles + Centering)
- [x] Recentered canvas using viewport bounds + padding
- [x] Swapped node glyphs to rounded rectangles with matching focus/aria proxies
- [ ] Overlay/callout exploration deferred (track for next iteration)

---

## Phase 1: Test Harness + Contracts

**Goal:** Verified helpers for graph mapping, color scale, tooltip formatting.

### Tasks
- [x] `GraphMapperTests` — API graph → internal model
- [x] `ColorScaleTests` — thresholds → palette
- [x] `TooltipFormatterTests` — compact metrics text

### Deliverables
- `GraphMapper.cs`, `ColorScale.cs`, tooltip helpers + tests.

---

## Phase 2: Canvas Component + Static Render

**Goal:** Mount canvas, draw nodes/edges, pan/zoom.

### Tasks
- [x] Render test: node count drawn
- [x] Implement draw loop + transforms
- [x] Extract layout math (refactor)

---

## Phase 3: Coloring + Scrubber Integration

**Goal:** Recolor on bin change within budget.

### Tasks
- [x] Render test: recolor on stubbed bin change
- [x] Hook global scrubber; fast update path
- [x] Memoization/refactor

---

## Phase 4: Hover/Focus Tooltips + Keyboard

**Goal:** Accessible info on hover/focus; navigation via keyboard.

### Tasks
- [x] Render test: tooltip show/hide
- [x] Hit‑test + placement
- [x] Keyboard nav + focus ring

---

## Phase 5: Layout Polish

**Goal:** Balance topology footprint, prep for overlay affordances.

### Tasks
- [x] Auto-center layout within canvas viewport
- [x] Rectangular glyphs + focus alignment
- [ ] Prototype label/overlay toggle (deferred)

---

## Notes / Blockers
- Overlay + badge treatments pushed to follow-up; design input needed.
 - Tooltips bug tracked in follow‑up milestone UI‑M‑03.22.1 (hover/focus not showing/placed correctly).
