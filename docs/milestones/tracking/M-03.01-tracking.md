## Progress Log

### Kickoff Session (Pending)

**Preparation:**
- [ ] Review milestone document and roadmap context
- [ ] Enumerate fixture runs used for validation
- [ ] Confirm branch `time-travel-m3` is up to date with latest `main`
- [ ] Draft initial test scaffolding plan

**Next Steps:**
- [x] Begin Phase 1 Task 1.1 (DTO scaffolding tests)
- [ ] Capture baseline golden output expectations

---

### 2025-10-14 — Phase 1/2 Kickoff

**Changes:**
- Authored `StateContractSerializationTests` to drive new time-travel DTOs, added `StateSnapshotResponse`/`StateWindowResponse` contracts under `FlowTime.Contracts`.
- Introduced `RunManifestReader` with telemetry source extraction and negative coverage, wiring it into `StateQueryService` along with the new metadata envelope.
- Reworked `/state` and `/state_window` handlers to emit enriched metadata/provenance plus telemetry hints; updated integration fixtures and assertions.

**Tests:**
- ✅ `dotnet test tests/FlowTime.Core.Tests`
- ✅ `dotnet test tests/FlowTime.Api.Tests`

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Flesh out mode-aware validation + warning surface (Phase 2.2).
- [ ] Add golden snapshots and logging assertions once response shape stabilises.
- [ ] Update `.http` samples and docs after validation work lands.

---

### 2025-10-15 — Mode Validation Pipeline

**Changes:**
- Implemented `ModeValidator` to enforce simulation requirements and surface telemetry source warnings; added provenance hash guard in `StateQueryService`.
- Propagated validator results through node telemetry metadata and response warnings; updated DI registration (`ModeValidator`) and error payload structure (`code`).
- Expanded integration/unit tests (`ModeValidatorTests`, `StateEndpointTests`) to cover new metadata, warnings, provenance behaviour, and NaN/telemetry warning paths.

**Tests:**
- ✅ `dotnet test tests/FlowTime.Core.Tests`
- ✅ `dotnet test tests/FlowTime.Api.Tests`

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Layer per-mode warning assertions in integration tests for telemetry warning scenarios (pending dedicated fixtures).
- [ ] Capture golden responses and observability verification before Phase 3 closure.

**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task 1.2: Implement RunManifestReader

**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task 1.3: Document Response Schema
**File(s):** `docs/schemas/time-travel-state-response.schema.json` (optional), `docs/milestones/M-03.01.md`

**Checklist (TDD Order):**
- [ ] Draft schema validation tests ensuring required fields present (RED)

## Phase 2: Endpoint & Validation Pipeline

**Goal:** Implement `/state` and `/state_window` handlers backed by mode-aware validation.

### Task 2.1: Adapt StateQueryService to Time-Travel Contracts
**File(s):** `src/FlowTime.API/Services/StateQueryService.cs`

**Checklist (TDD Order):**
- [x] Update integration test (`StateEndpointTests.GetState_ReturnsSnapshotWithDerivedMetrics`) to fail on legacy payload (RED)

- [ ] Refresh roadmap & decision log references to mark milestone active (GREEN)
- [ ] Capture verification notes in tracking log (GREEN)

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started

### Phase 3 Validation

- [ ] Run full solution tests (`dotnet test FlowTime.sln`)
- [ ] Manually execute `.http` samples against local API
- [ ] Confirm documentation links render correctly

---

## Testing & Validation

### Test Case 1: `/state` happy path
- [ ] Call `/v1/runs/{fixtureRun}/state?binIndex=42`
- [ ] Expect `200` with populated metadata, derived metrics, empty warnings for simulation run
- [ ] Verify log entry includes `runId=fixtureRun` and `mode=simulation`

### Test Case 2: `/state_window` range validation
- [ ] Call `/v1/runs/{fixtureRun}/state_window?startBin=50&endBin=30`
- [ ] Expect `400` with `invalid_range` error code
- [ ] Confirm no snapshot builder invocation

### Test Case 3: Provenance mismatch
- [ ] Manipulate request to supply stale hash header (if exposed) or altered manifest path
- [ ] Expect `409` with expected vs actual hash in response
- [ ] Warning counter increments in logs/metrics
