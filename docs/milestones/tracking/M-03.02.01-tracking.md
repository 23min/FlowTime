## Current Status

### Overall Progress
- [x] Phase 1: Service Layer Refactor (3/3 tasks)
- [x] Phase 2: API & CLI Integration (3/3 tasks)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tests, Observability, Documentation (3/4 tasks)

### Test Status
- Unit Tests: 3 / planned (RunOrchestrationService simulation coverage + CLI orchestration reuse)
- Integration Tests: 2 / planned (API `/v1/runs` simulation path + validation failure)
- Golden Tests: 2 / planned (simulation create/get snapshots)
- CI Build: `dotnet build FlowTime.sln`

## Progress Log

### 2025-10-18 — Planning

- [x] Drafted milestone spec `M-03.02.01.md` outlining simulation-mode orchestration scope.
- [x] Created tracking document; no implementation work started.
- [ ] Backend branch kickoff (pending).
- [ ] Re-affirm TDD workflow before each task (tests first, then implementation, then refactor).

### 2025-10-19 — Service & API Integration

- [x] Refactored `RunOrchestrationService` for simulation mode (FlowTime.Sim evaluation, canonical artifact emission, telemetry manifest writer, structured logs/metrics).
- [x] Updated `/v1/runs` to accept simulation payloads, surface validation errors, and return `/state`-aligned metadata + `canReplay` (simulation).
- [x] Routed CLI `flowtime run --template-id <id> --mode simulation` through orchestration service; added CLI simulation test coverage.
- [x] Added generator/API/golden tests for simulation runs; updated `FlowTime.API.http` with simulation samples and refreshed milestone documentation.

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Service Layer Refactor

Goal: Extend `RunOrchestrationService` to support simulation mode without telemetry dependencies.

Checklist:
- [x] Mode branching implemented (simulation vs telemetry).
- [x] Synthetic artifact generation (run.json, manifest, index).
- [x] Simulation validation/warning semantics applied.

Status: ✅ Complete

### Phase 2: API & CLI Integration

Goal: Wire simulation orchestration into REST API and CLI.

Checklist:
- [x] `POST /v1/runs` simulation path returns metadata envelope.
- [x] Response includes artifact presence flags and `canReplay`.
- [x] CLI (`flowtime run --mode simulation`) reuses orchestration service.

Status: ✅ Complete

### Phase 3: Tests, Observability, Documentation

Goal: Ensure coverage, instrumentation, and docs for simulation runs.

Checklist:
- [x] Unit & integration tests implemented and passing.
- [x] Golden snapshots captured for API responses.
- [x] Structured logs/metrics verified in simulation mode (log hooks + metric counters).
- [ ] Documentation updates (`.http` samples, operator guide, release notes).

Status: 🚧 In Progress

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Shared artifacts for telemetry vs simulation** — ensure file writers handle both paths consistently. Mitigation: unit tests on artifact generation.
- **Validation severity divergence** — simulation must fail fast; telemetry warns. Mitigation: tests covering both modes.
- **CLI/API drift** — reuse orchestration service; integration tests for CLI parity.

---

## Next Steps

1. Finish documentation updates (operator guide refresh, release notes draft) and capture observability verification notes.
2. Coordinate with UI team once simulation runs succeed to unblock UI-M-03.12.
3. Schedule metrics dashboards validation after instrumentation lands in shared environment.
