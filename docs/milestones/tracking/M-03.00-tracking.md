## Progress Log

### Kickoff Session

**Preparation:**

**Tests:**

- [ ] Integration tests (file-sourced time grid, start time propagation)
- [ ] Regression sweep: `dotnet test` full solution

**Exit Criteria:**
- All new tests passing; no skipped tests.
- Full solution builds cleanly with fixtures included.
- Existing regression suite (M-02.10) remains green.

## Issues & Risks

- Serena MCP tooling unavailable in Codex environment; ensure manual edits stay scoped and linted.
- Fixture CSV authoring may be time-consuming; consider scripting generation to avoid manual errors.
- Large number of new files may require incremental commits; maintain RED→GREEN discipline.

## Summary

- Implementation complete across phases 1-5.
- Integration suite verifies fixture pipeline.
- Ready for milestone wrap (documentation + demo).
