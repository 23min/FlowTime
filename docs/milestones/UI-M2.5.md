# UI-M2.5 â€” Navigation Architecture Enhancement

> **ðŸ“‹ Charter Notice**: This milestone has been superseded by the [FlowTime-Engine Charter](../flowtime-engine-charter.md). The Engine+Sim navigation structure described here aligns with charter principles but implementation details now follow [M2.8 Incremental Charter UI](M2.8-UI-INCREMENTAL.md).

> **Target Project:** FlowTime UI  
> **Prerequisites:** UI-M2 âœ…  
> **Status:** Charter Superseded *(originally IN PROGRESS)*  
> **Branch:** `feature/ui-dual-interface/route-based-architecture`

## Goal

Implement clear Engine vs Sim navigation structure that reinforces architectural distinctions through URL patterns, grouped navigation, and visual indicators. Make the FlowTime Engine vs FlowTime-Sim separation crystal clear to users.

## What We're Accomplishing

- **Route-Based Clarity:** Move FlowTime-Sim pages under `/sim/*` prefix for architectural clarity
- **Grouped Navigation:** Organize navigation into ANALYZE (Engine), SIMULATE (Sim), and TOOLS sections
- **Visual Indicators:** Add system attribution chips and color coding to reinforce distinctions
- **Enhanced Page Titles:** Include system context in all page titles and metadata
- **URL Self-Documentation:** Make bookmarks and shared URLs immediately clear about which system

## Why This Approach

- **Mental Model Alignment:** URL structure matches architectural reality (Engine vs Sim)
- **User Clarity:** Eliminate confusion about which system they're using
- **Future Scalability:** Clean organization for additional pages in each category
- **API Alignment:** `/sim/*` UI routes mirror `/sim/*` API endpoints
- **Documentation:** URLs become self-documenting for users and developers

## Technical Architecture

### URL Structure
```
/                       â†’ Home
/features              â†’ FlowTime Engine (Features)
/api-demo              â†’ FlowTime Engine (API Testing)
/scenarios             â†’ FlowTime Engine (Scenario Composer) - future
/sim/templates         â†’ FlowTime-Sim (Template Studio)
/sim/catalogs          â†’ FlowTime-Sim (Catalog Browser) - future
/health                â†’ Tools (System Health)
/learn/*               â†’ Learning Interface
```

### Navigation Structure
```
ðŸ“Š ANALYZE (FlowTime Engine)
   â”œâ”€ Features (/features)
   â”œâ”€ API Demo (/api-demo) 
   â””â”€ Scenarios (/scenarios) - future
ðŸŽ² SIMULATE (FlowTime-Sim)
   â”œâ”€ Templates (/sim/templates)
   â””â”€ Catalogs (/sim/catalogs) - future
ðŸ”§ TOOLS
   â”œâ”€ Health (/health)
   â””â”€ Settings (/settings) - future
ðŸŽ“ LEARN
   â””â”€ Getting Started (â†’ /learn/welcome)
```

## Functional Requirements

### FR-UI-M2.5-1: Route-Based System Separation âœ…
- Move TemplateRunner from `/templates` to `/sim/templates`
- Establish `/sim/*` prefix for all FlowTime-Sim related pages
- Maintain existing `/learn/*` structure for Learning Interface
- Keep FlowTime Engine pages at root level (`/features`, `/api-demo`, etc.)

### FR-UI-M2.5-2: Flat Navigation with Visual Hierarchy âœ…
- Implement flat navigation structure with section headers and indented submenus
- Add visual hierarchy through CSS indentation and styling
- Include system attribution chips (Engine/FlowTime-Sim) in section headers
- Use consistent iconography and color schemes
- Create landing pages for ANALYZE, SIMULATE, and TOOLS sections

### FR-UI-M2.5-3: Enhanced Page Titles and Metadata âœ…
- Update all page titles to include system context
- Format: "Page Name (FlowTime Engine)" or "Page Name (FlowTime-Sim)"
- Ensure browser tabs and bookmarks are immediately clear
- Update PageTitle directives in all Razor components

### FR-UI-M2.5-4: Visual Mode Indicators âœ…
- Add color coding: Primary blue for Engine, Secondary purple for Sim
- Include small system chips in navigation groups
- Use consistent iconography (Analytics for Engine, Casino for Sim)
- Maintain existing Demo/API mode toggle functionality

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Route Updates
- [x] Update `TemplateRunner.razor` @page directive to `/sim/templates`
- [x] Update all navigation links to use new `/sim/templates` route
- [ ] Test route navigation and ensure no broken links

### 2. Navigation Structure
- [x] Replace expanding groups with flat navigation and visual hierarchy
- [x] Add ANALYZE, SIMULATE, TOOLS section headers with landing pages
- [x] Include system attribution chips in section headers
- [x] Implement CSS-based indentation for submenus
- [x] Create informative landing pages for each major section

### 3. Page Enhancements
- [x] Update page titles with system context
- [x] Ensure consistent PageTitle directives
- [x] Add visual indicators where appropriate

### 4. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Verify all routes navigate correctly
- [ ] Test navigation groups expand/collapse properly
- [ ] Ensure mobile navigation works with new structure
- [ ] Validate that existing functionality is preserved

## Expected User Benefits

1. **Immediate Clarity** - URL tells users which system they're using
2. **Better Mental Model** - Navigation structure matches architectural reality
3. **Improved Bookmarking** - Self-documenting URLs (`/sim/templates` vs `/templates`)
4. **Reduced Confusion** - Clear visual separation between Engine and Sim workflows
5. **Future Scalability** - Clean organization for additional features

- âœ… Mobile navigation works with grouped structure
- âœ… No broken links or navigation issues
- âœ… URL structure is self-documenting and consistent
