# Milestone M16 — WASM Engine (Browser‑Run) — Future

Goal
Run the FlowTime engine entirely in the browser (no API round‑trip) for interactive what‑if modeling, demos, and offline scenarios. Maintain parity with server runs.

Why
- Zero‑infrastructure demos and easy OSS adoption (GitHub Pages, local files)
- Fast iteration loops for small/medium models
- Privacy: explore overlays fully client‑side

Scope
- WASM binding that exposes the same run API as the server engine (no HTTP)
- UI toggle: Run Mode = Server (API) or Browser (WASM)
- Resource target: ~150 nodes × 7–14 days × 5m bins with AOT enabled

Design
- Projects: `src/FlowTime.Core.Wasm` (binding) referencing `FlowTime.Core`
- Keep DTOs/results identical to server to avoid UI drift
- Build flags: SIMD (`WasmEnableSIMD=true`); optional AOT (`RunAOTCompilation=true`)

Deliverables
- `src/FlowTime.Core.Wasm` + UI wiring
- Parity tests (shared golden vectors) and basic perf harness
- `docs/wasm.md` with build/publish instructions and known limits

Notes
- WASM is for what‑if; live what‑is/was remains server/API
- Consider MessagePack or similar later for faster client‑side loads
