# Milestone M16 â€” WASM Engine (Browserâ€‘Run) â€” Future

> **ðŸ“‹ Charter Notice**: This future milestone predates the [FlowTime-Engine Charter](../flowtime-engine-charter.md). WASM capabilities may be reconsidered within the charter execution framework. See [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) for current development priorities.

Goal
Run the FlowTime engine entirely in the browser (no API roundâ€‘trip) for interactive whatâ€‘if modeling, demos, and offline scenarios. Maintain parity with server runs.

Why
- Zeroâ€‘infrastructure demos and easy OSS adoption (GitHub Pages, local files)
- Fast iteration loops for small/medium models
- Privacy: explore overlays fully clientâ€‘side

Scope
- WASM binding that exposes the same run API as the server engine (no HTTP)
- UI toggle: Run Mode = Server (API) or Browser (WASM)
- Resource target: ~150 nodes Ã— 7â€“14 days Ã— 5m bins with AOT enabled

Design
- Projects: `src/FlowTime.Core.Wasm` (binding) referencing `FlowTime.Core`
- Keep DTOs/results identical to server to avoid UI drift
- Build flags: SIMD (`WasmEnableSIMD=true`); optional AOT (`RunAOTCompilation=true`)

Deliverables
- `src/FlowTime.Core.Wasm` + UI wiring
- Parity tests (shared golden vectors) and basic perf harness
- `docs/wasm.md` with build/publish instructions and known limits

Notes
- WASM is for whatâ€‘if; live whatâ€‘is/was remains server/API
- Consider MessagePack or similar later for faster clientâ€‘side loads
