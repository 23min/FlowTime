# Milestone SIM-M3.0 â€” Charter-Aligned Model Authoring Platform

> **ðŸ“‹ Charter Alignment**: This milestone number has been updated to align with [FlowTime-Engine Charter Roadmap](../../../flowtime-vnext/docs/milestones/CHARTER-ROADMAP.md) which references SIM-M3.0 as the Sim charter milestone.

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Planned (Charter-Aligned)  
**Dependencies:** SIM-M2.1 (PMF Generator Support), FlowTime Engine M2.7 (Artifacts Registry Foundation)  
**Target:** FlowTime-Sim as charter-compliant model authoring platform  
**Date:** 2025-10-01

---

## Goal

Transform **FlowTime-Sim** from demonstration tool to **charter-compliant model authoring platform** that creates and validates model artifacts for the FlowTime-Engine ecosystem. This milestone establishes FlowTime-Sim as the primary path for creating model artifacts that flow seamlessly into the [Models] â†’ [Runs] â†’ [Artifacts] â†’ [Learn] charter workflow.

## Context & Charter Alignment

The **FlowTime-Sim Charter v1.0** defines Sim as the **"modeling front-end"** that generates models but **never computes telemetry**. This milestone implements that vision by positioning FlowTime-Sim as the **model authoring platform**:

- **Model Creation**: Catalog-based model authoring with validation and export
- **Artifact Generation**: Models saved as artifacts compatible with Engine registry
- **Charter Compliance**: Zero telemetry generation - pure model authoring focus
- **Engine Integration**: Seamless handoff from Sim (model authoring) to Engine (execution platform)

This milestone establishes the **charter-compliant ecosystem flow**:
```
FlowTime-Sim (Create Models) â†’ FlowTime-Engine (Execute & Analyze) â†’ Compare & Learn
```

  - **Warnings**: Allow export with caveats (unusual parameter ranges, complex expressions)
  - **Info**: Suggestions for improvement (parameter optimization, structure simplification)

â€¢ **Quality Assessment Metrics (Structure-Only):**
  - **Completeness Score**: Configuration detail, metadata completeness, documentation quality
  - **Consistency Score**: Parameter relationships, expression logic, node dependencies
