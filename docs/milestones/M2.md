# Milestone M2

## Scenarios

- Probabilistic arrivals/attempts: represent uncertainty with a PMF and use expected value series for quick scenario math.
- Examples:
  - attempts.pmf = { 1: 0.6, 2: 0.3, 3: 0.1 } → expected attempts per bin.
  - combine PMF‑derived series with capacity via basic arithmetic to estimate load.

## How the code works

- PMF definitions are parsed and normalized.
- A PmfNode emits an expected‑value Series aligned to the grid.
- Downstream nodes consume this series like any other, using BinaryOp/Add/Mul to combine with baselines or capacity.

## Why it’s useful now

- Quick, explainable uncertainty modeling without full Monte Carlo.
- Fits cleanly into the node graph; deterministic and auditable.
