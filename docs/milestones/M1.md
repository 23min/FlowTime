# Milestone M1

## Scenarios

- Spreadsheet‑style formulas and references: define new series from other series with arithmetic and simple built‑ins.
- Examples:
  - served = demand * 0.8 + SHIFT(demand, 1)
  - cost = volume * unitCost; total = a + b
  - Lead/lag simple transforms for sanity checks and projections.

## How the code works

- Expression parser turns `expr:` strings into an AST.
- The AST compiles to the same node graph used in M0:
  - Binary operations (+, -, *, /) map to BinaryOpNode.
  - SHIFT(series, k) maps to a ShiftNode (new in M1).
  - Identifiers resolve to existing node outputs.
- The graph validates, orders topologically, and evaluates deterministically on the canonical grid.

## Why it’s useful now

- Author models in a familiar spreadsheet idiom.
- Encode time relationships (lead/lag) without hand‑building intermediate nodes.
- Sets the stage for richer built‑ins (CLAMP/MIN/MAX) and, later, queue/backlog logic.
