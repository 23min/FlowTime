# Capability Matrix (Snapshot)

> **ðŸ“‹ Charter Notice**: This capability matrix reflects pre-charter milestones (M-00.00â€“M-02.06). For current development capabilities and roadmap, see [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md).

Legend: Done / Prototype / Partial / Planned.

| UI Real API Integration | HTTP services, real simulation execution, artifact-first patterns | Done (UI-M-02.00) âœ… | Complete FlowTime-Sim integration with series streaming |
| UI Graph | Structural table (order, degrees, roles) | Done | Visual DAG planned for later |
| Simulation Mode | Deterministic synthetic run + graph | Done | Toggle persisted (flag + query) |
| Synthetic Adapter (SYN-M-0) | Read artifacts & produce series | Done (SYN-M-0) | FileSeriesReader, RunArtifactAdapter complete |
| Backlog & Latency | Single-queue backlog + Little's Law latency | Planned (M-7) | Not pulled forward in current roadmap |
| Testing | Core unit tests & API slice + CLI parity + artifact endpoints | Done | 35/35 tests passing including enhanced artifact validation |
| Docs | README, roadmap, node concepts, releases | Done | Complete documentation for all milestones |

**Charter Status**: This matrix reflects completed pre-charter work. Current development follows [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) with artifacts-centric milestones.
