# Legacy Documentation Archive

This folder contains historical planning documents from the "Charter Era" (September 2025) that have been superseded by simplified KISS architecture.

## Why These Documents Were Archived

In late September 2025, FlowTime-Sim planning became overengineered with:
- Dual-registry synchronization complexity
- Engine-first development strategy
- "Charter violation" framing
- Overengineered milestones (SIM-M2.8, SIM-M2.9)

**KISS Decision:** Single registry (Engine), temporary storage (Sim), UI orchestrates. This reduced complexity by ~85%.

## Archived Documents

### Planning Documents
- **ROADMAP-CHARTER-ERA.md** - Original roadmap with two-phase strategy
- **DEVELOPMENT-STATUS-CHARTER-ERA.md** - Charter transition status assessment
- **CHARTER-TRANSITION-PLAN.md** - Strategic plan for Engine-first development

### Milestones
- **SIM-M2.9-CHARTER-ERA.md** - Compare integration with quality scores (overengineered)

## What Superseded These

**NEW-ROADMAP.md** (October 2025) provides:
- Clear current state (v0.4.0)
- Simple milestone sequence (M2.6.1 → M2.7 → v1.0.0)
- KISS architecture principles
- No time estimates
- Decision log explaining choices

## Deleted (Not Archived)

- **SIM-M2.8.md** - Contradicted KISS architecture (auto-registration, dual-registry sync)
- **SIM-M2.6-CHARTER.md** - Superseded by SIM-M2.6-CORRECTIVE (v0.4.0)

## Historical Value

These documents show:
- Evolution of architectural thinking
- Why dual-registry was rejected
- Strategic decision-making process
- Charter transition challenges

Kept for historical context and learning, not as active guidance.
