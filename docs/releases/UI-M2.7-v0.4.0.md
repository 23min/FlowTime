## ðŸŽ¯ Milestone Summary

UI-M2.7 delivers the **Artifacts Registry UI**, creating the foundation for the charter's "never forget" principle by making all FlowTime artifacts discoverable and manageable through intuitive interfaces.

### âœ… Core Deliverables

**Artifacts Browser Interface**
- Complete `/artifacts` page with search, filter, and sort capabilities
- Multi-select with bulk archive/delete operations
- Type filtering (runs/models/telemetry), date filtering, tag-based filtering
- Responsive MudBlazor data grid with pagination support
- Real-time artifact count and "Show Archived" toggle

**Artifact Detail Views**
- Individual `/artifacts/{id}` pages with comprehensive metadata display
- File listings with download links and file type icons
- Basic information panel (type, created date, size, file count)
- Tag display with proper chip formatting
- Back navigation to registry browser

**API Integration**
- Full integration with M2.7/M2.8 artifacts registry endpoints
- Consumes `/v1/artifacts` for listing with query parameters
- Consumes `/v1/artifacts/{id}` for individual artifact details
- Bulk operations via `/v1/artifacts/archive` and `/v1/artifacts/bulk-delete`
- Error handling and loading states throughout

**Charter Navigation Integration**
- ARTIFACTS section added to ExpertLayout navigation
- Accessible via main navigation drawer
- Proper integration with existing MudBlazor design system

### ðŸ§ª Test Coverage Additions

**UI Test Suite (`FlowTime.UI.Tests`)**
- `TemplateServiceMetadataTests` - validates YAML metadata generation and FlowTime-Sim translation
- Added YamlDotNet dependency for metadata parsing tests
- Reflection helpers for testing private template methods

**API Test Suite (`FlowTime.Api.Tests`)**
- `FileSystemArtifactRegistryUnitTests` - tests metadata tag extraction and archived filtering
- Enhanced `ArtifactEndpointTests` - integration tests for archive/bulk delete endpoints
- Run ID generation fixes for proper artifact scanning compliance

### ðŸ“‹ Documented Deferrals

**Relationships UI (â†’ UI-M2.9)**
- Related artifact links in detail view
- Compare-from-detail shortcuts
- `/v1/artifacts/{id}/relationships` endpoint UI integration

**Advanced Filtering Enhancements**
- File size filtering UI (backend support exists)
- Full-text search parameters (backend support exists)
- Enhanced pagination performance optimization

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

**Key Components**
- `Pages/Artifacts.razor` - main registry browser
- `Pages/ArtifactDetail.razor` - individual artifact detail view
- `Components/Dialogs/ConfirmBulkActionDialog.razor` - bulk operation confirmations

**API Services**
- Enhanced HTTP client factory integration
- Proper error handling with user feedback
- Loading states and progress indicators

**State Management**
- Artifact selection state for bulk operations
- Filter persistence during navigation
- Archive/show archived toggle with automatic refresh

## ðŸš€ Ready for Next Steps

**UI-M2.8 Prerequisites Met**
- Charter navigation structure in place
- Artifacts accessible via main navigation
- Foundation for charter tab system prepared

**UI-M2.9 Foundation Established**

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics Achieved

**User Experience**
- âœ… Artifact discovery within 3 clicks via navigation â†’ artifacts â†’ detail
- âœ… Search/filter operations responsive with loading indicators
- âœ… File download functionality working for all artifact types

- âœ… Error states provide clear user guidance
- âœ… Clean integration with existing MudBlazor design system
- âœ… All tests passing (167 total, 0 failed)

**Charter Alignment**

## ðŸ”„ Migration Notes

**For UI-M2.8 Development**
- Relationships deferral documented in milestone scope
- Charter navigation structure ready for tab system migration
- Artifact selector components prepared for cross-workflow use

**For UI-M2.9 Development**
- `/v1/artifacts/{id}/relationships` endpoint available but not UI-integrated
- Compare action patterns established in bulk operations
- Detail view structure ready for relationships panel addition

This release successfully completes UI-M2.7 with strategic scope management, ensuring quality delivery while maintaining clear roadmap progression.
