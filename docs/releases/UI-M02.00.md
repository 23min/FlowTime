> **Release Date:** September 5, 2025  
> **Branch:** feature/ui-m2/api-integration  
> **Status:** COMPLETED ‚úÖ

---

## Overview

UI-M2 delivers a comprehensive enhancement to the FlowTime Template Runner, combining reliable mode switching, improved user experience, AND full real API integration with FlowTime-Sim services. This release transforms the UI from mock-based to production-ready with artifact-first architecture.

## Major Features

### üîÑ **Real API Integration**
- **FlowTimeSimApiClient**: Direct integration with FlowTime-Sim `/sim/run`, `/sim/runs/{id}/index`, `/sim/runs/{id}/series/{seriesId}`
- **SimResultsService**: Parses CSV streams from canonical run artifacts
- **Artifact-First Architecture**: Follows `series/index.json` discovery pattern, eliminates custom metadata dependencies
- **Schema Compliance**: Full `schemaVersion: 1` contract compliance

### üéöÔ∏è **Reliable Mode Switching**
- **Persistent Mode Toggle**: Mode selection survives browser sessions via localStorage
- **Component State Management**: Proper subscription patterns with automatic refresh
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear mode banners and transition indicators

### üí° **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Disabled State UX**: Clear tooltips explaining why actions are unavailable
- **Alert Guidance**: Contextual messages guide users through incomplete selections
- **Component Remounting**: Eliminates stale state issues during mode changes
- **Loading States**: Proper feedback during template and catalog operations

### üß™ **Test Coverage & Quality**
- **Expanded Coverage**: 33 ‚Üí 35 tests (100% passing)
- **API Endpoint Tests**: Critical coverage for artifact handling and FileNotFoundException ‚Üí 404 conversion
- **Clean Dependencies**: Removed unused Moq package, optimized project structure

### üìÅ **Repository Organization**
- **Scripts Directory**: Consolidated development files under `scripts/` with comprehensive README
- **Integration Testing**: Updated test scripts for current API endpoints
- **Documentation**: Aligned with actual implementation and artifact-first patterns

## Technical Achievements

### Service Layer Implementation
- **Real HTTP Services**: Complete replacement of UI-M1 mocks with actual API calls
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful fallbacks and proper 404 handling for missing artifacts
- **Timeout Configuration**: Robust network handling with configurable timeouts

### Component Architecture
- **Subscription Patterns**: Components properly respond to mode changes
- **State Isolation**: Clean separation between SIM and API mode states
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Reactive updates when feature flags or modes change

### Integration Compliance
- **Artifact-First**: No custom JSON blobs, only canonical run artifacts
- **Endpoint Standards**: Follows archived `docs/archive/flowtime-sim-integration-spec-legacy.md` patterns
- **Series Discovery**: Dynamic loading via `series/index.json` parsing

## API Endpoints Integrated

### FlowTime-Sim Integration
```http
POST /sim/run                           # Simulation execution
GET  /sim/runs/{id}/index              # Artifact discovery
GET  /sim/runs/{id}/series/{seriesId}  # CSV data streaming
GET  /sim/scenarios                    # Template scenarios
```

### FlowTime API Integration
```http
GET  /runs/{id}/series/{seriesId}      # Artifact reading (enhanced)
POST /run                              # Direct execution
GET  /healthz                          # Service health
```

## Breaking Changes

### None for End Users
- All UI-M1 functionality preserved
- Mode switching is additive enhancement
- Backward compatibility maintained

### For Developers
- Mock services replaced with real HTTP implementations
- Custom metadata patterns eliminated in favor of artifact-first
- Repository structure reorganized with scripts/ directory

---

## Migration Guide

### From UI-M1
No user migration required. All existing functionality works with enhanced reliability and real API integration.

### For Developers
1. **Update Service Registration**: Real HTTP services now registered by default
2. **Use Scripts Directory**: Development files moved from root to `scripts/`
3. **Follow Artifact Patterns**: Use `series/index.json` for result discovery
4. **Remove Mock Dependencies**: Clean up any hardcoded mock assumptions

---

## Testing Coverage

### New Test Categories
- **API Endpoint Tests**: Missing index.json handling, partial series name matching
- **Integration Scripts**: Comprehensive testing for all API endpoints
- **Error Handling**: 404 vs 500 response validation

### Test Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 35 (was 33)
- **Success Rate**: 100% (35/35 passing)
- **Coverage Areas**: API endpoints, artifact handling, series streaming

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current State
- Real-time progress polling not yet implemented (planned for future milestone)
- Authentication/authorization not yet integrated (planned for production deployment)
- Advanced caching strategies deferred to performance optimization milestone

### Future Enhancements
- Background progress polling service
- Enhanced error recovery and retry logic
- Performance optimization for large result sets
- Collaborative features for shared simulations

---

## Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies
- FlowTime-Sim service running on configured endpoint
