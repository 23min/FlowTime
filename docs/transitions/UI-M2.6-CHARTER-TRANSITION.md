# UI-M2.6 — Export/Import Workflow (Charter Transition)

**Status:** ✅ Complete (Charter-Aligned)  
**Dependencies:** M2.6 (Export/Import Loop), UI-M2.5 (Navigation)  
**Superseded By:** UI-M2.7, UI-M2.8, UI-M2.9, UI-M3.0 (Charter UI Milestone Structure)  
**Owner:** UI Team

> **Charter Transition Complete:** UI-M2.6 work successfully transitioned to dedicated UI milestones. Export foundation preserved and enhanced through charter-aligned UI architecture. All UI implementation now properly structured across UI-M2.7 (Artifacts UI), UI-M2.8 (Charter Navigation), UI-M2.9 (Compare UI), and UI-M3.0 (Cross-Platform Integration).

---

## Original Goal (Superseded)

Enable users to close the modeling loop through UI-driven export and import workflows with persistent artifacts management. This milestone was planned to create comprehensive export/import UI workflows and artifacts registry interface.

## Charter Realignment Impact

The **FlowTime-Engine Charter** fundamentally changes UI architecture from export/import-focused to **artifacts-centric workflow**. Original UI-M2.6 scope conflicts with charter paradigm:

### **Original UI-M2.6 Approach (Export-Centric)**
```
Templates → Run → Results → Export/Import Actions → File Management
```

### **Charter Approach (Artifacts-Centric)**
```
[Models] → [Runs] → [Artifacts] → [Learn] with persistent registry navigation
```

### **Paradigm Shift Required**
- **Export Actions** → **Artifact Creation** (automatic, not user-initiated)
- **Import Workflows** → **Artifact Registry Browsing**
- **File Management** → **Persistent Artifact Navigation**
- **Results Pages** → **Contextual Artifact Actions** (Compare, Export, Analyze)

## Completed Work Status

### **✅ Export UI Integration (M2.6 Complete)**
Basic export functionality already implemented in M2.6:
- Export checkbox on TemplateRunner results
- Export download from API with format selection
- Export notifications and error handling
- HttpClient integration for export endpoints

### **❌ Comprehensive Export UI (Cancelled)**
Advanced export workflows cancelled in favor of charter approach:
- Bulk export operations → Charter artifacts registry bulk actions
- Export history management → Charter artifacts browsing
- Advanced export configuration → Charter artifact metadata
- Export scheduling → Charter workflow automation

### **❌ Import UI Workflows (Cancelled)**  
Import UI workflows cancelled in favor of charter approach:
- File upload dialogs → Charter telemetry artifact upload
- Import validation UI → Charter artifact validation
- Import history tracking → Charter artifacts registry
- Data mapping interfaces → Charter artifact metadata editing

## Charter Migration Strategy (Completed)

UI-M2.6 work successfully transitioned to **dedicated UI milestone structure**:

### **✅ UI-M2.7: Artifacts Registry UI**
- Comprehensive artifacts browsing and management interface
- Search, filtering, and artifact action capabilities
- Integration with M2.7 artifacts registry backend
- Reusable artifact selector components for charter workflows

### **✅ UI-M2.8: Charter Navigation & Tab Structure**  
- Charter tab navigation system ([Models] → [Runs] → [Artifacts] → [Learn])
- Workflow context management and state persistence
- Tab content components for charter workflow stages
- Backward compatibility with existing TemplateRunner

### **✅ UI-M2.9: Compare Workflow UI Integration**
- Comprehensive comparison workflow user interfaces
- Visual comparison components with side-by-side views
- Charter integration for contextual comparison actions
- Cross-platform comparison capabilities preparation

### **✅ UI-M3.0: Cross-Platform Charter Integration**
- Unified charter navigation spanning Engine and Sim platforms
- Embedded model authoring interface within charter workflow
- Cross-platform workflow integration and state management
- Simulation integration UI components

## Lessons Learned

### **Early Charter Alignment Critical**
- Charter paradigm shift requires fundamental UI rethinking
- Export/import-centric UI conflicts with artifacts-centric charter
- Early charter alignment prevents wasted UI development

### **Incremental Migration Safer**
- Preserve working functionality during major architecture changes
- Parallel UI structures reduce risk during transition
- User adoption easier with familiar functionality available

### **Export Foundation Valuable**
- M2.6 export integration provides foundation for charter artifact generation
- Basic export patterns translate to charter artifact actions
- Export service architecture scales to charter artifact services

## Impact on Charter Milestones (Realized)

### **UI-M2.7 Artifacts Registry UI**
UI-M2.6 artifacts concepts successfully realized:
- ✅ Persistent artifact browsing and management interface
- ✅ Advanced search, filtering, and metadata display
- ✅ Artifact action patterns (View, Compare, Download, Export)
- ✅ Charter workflow integration with artifact selection

### **UI-M2.8 Charter Navigation & Tab Structure**  
UI-M2.6 incremental transition approach successful:
- ✅ Preserved existing export functionality through backward compatibility
- ✅ Charter tabs added without disrupting established workflows
- ✅ User experience continuity maintained during architectural transition
- ✅ Workflow context management enables seamless charter progression

### **UI-M2.9 Compare Workflow UI Integration**
UI-M2.6 contextual action concepts fully implemented:
- ✅ Artifact-based comparison workflows integrated into charter navigation
- ✅ Results page integration with contextual comparison actions
- ✅ Workflow state management preserves comparison context across sessions
- ✅ Visual comparison interfaces provide intuitive difference analysis

## Transition Plan

### **Immediate Actions**
1. ✅ **Pause UI-M2.6 development** to avoid charter conflicts
2. ✅ **Preserve M2.6 export integration** as charter foundation
3. ✅ **Plan M2.8 incremental migration** using UI-M2.6 lessons

### **Charter Development Sequence**
1. **M2.7 Artifacts Registry** - Backend artifact persistence and API
2. **M2.8 Registry Integration + UI-M2.8 Charter Navigation** - Backend integration and charter tabs UI
3. **M2.9 Compare Workflow** - Charter contextual actions and workflows

### **User Experience Continuity**
- Existing export functionality remains available throughout transition
- Users can continue current workflows while charter features are added
- No disruption to established usage patterns during migration

## Success Metrics (Revised for Charter)

### **Charter Transition Success**
- ✅ **No functionality regression** during charter migration
- ✅ **User workflow continuity** maintained throughout transition  
- ✅ **Charter adoption** measured by usage of new [Artifacts] and Compare features

### **Technical Success**
- ✅ **Charter UI performance** meets or exceeds existing UI performance
- ✅ **Artifact registry usability** improves on existing export/import workflows
- ✅ **Integration reliability** maintains existing export system reliability
