# Nodes, Expressions, and Execution

> **ðŸ“‹ Charter Context**: This document describes core engine concepts that remain central to the [FlowTime-Engine Charter](../flowtime-engine-charter.md). The execution engine and node system directly support the charter's artifacts-centric workflow by producing structured, deterministic outputs.

This document explains how FlowTime represents models internally (nodes and graphs), how expressions map to nodes, and how evaluation executes deterministically on a canonical time grid. These capabilities form the execution core of the charter paradigm: **[Models] â†’ [Runs] â†’ [Artifacts] â†’ [Learn]**.

This document explains how FlowTime represents models internally (nodes and graphs), how expressions map to nodes, and how evaluation executes deterministically on a canonical time grid. It also shows how todayâ€™s M0 implementation works and how it evolves per the roadmap.

## Mental model

Think of FlowTime as a spreadsheet for flows:
- The time axis is a fixed grid of bins (e.g., 8 bins, 60 minutes each).
- Each node produces a numeric series aligned to the grid.
- Edges express dependencies between nodes, like spreadsheet cell references.
- Evaluation is deterministic and ordered topologically: inputs first, outputs last.

## The building blocks

- TimeGrid
  - Fixed number of bins and binMinutes. All series align to this grid.
- Series
  - A contiguous double[] representing a value per bin. Immutable by contract (copy on write in nodes).
- NodeId
  - Stable identity for a node in a graph.
- INode
  - Contract: Id, Inputs, Evaluate(grid, getInput).
- Graph
  - Manages nodes, checks for cycles, derives a topological order, and memoizes evaluation results.

## Current nodes (M0)

- ConstSeriesNode
  - Emits a fixed series of doubles with length == grid.Bins.
- BinaryOpNode
  - Performs Add or Mul over time series.
  - Inputs: left series and either a right series or a scalarRight.
  - Todayâ€™s YAML exprs ("name * k", "name + k") compile to BinaryOpNode with scalarRight.

These form the minimal set to enable simple what-if scenarios right away.

## Expressions and compilation

Expressions are the authoring surface. Behind the scenes, FlowTime compiles expressions to node graphs. In M0, we support tiny inline exprs that translate to a BinaryOpNode with scalar RHS. In later milestones (M1+), a real parser will support:
- Arithmetic: +, -, *, /
- Functions: SHIFT, DELAY, RESAMPLE, CLAMP, MIN, MAX, etc.
- References: identifiers for other nodes

### Example: from expression to nodes

Expression (YAML):
```yaml
nodes:
  - id: demand
    kind: const
    values: [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]
  - id: served
    kind: expr
    expr: "demand * 0.8"
```

Compilation (conceptually):
- demand â†’ ConstSeriesNode("demand")
- served â†’ BinaryOpNode("served", left=demand, op=Mul, scalarRight=0.8)

Graph edges:
- demand â†’ served

Evaluation order:
- [demand, served]

### Future expressions

Example (planned):
```yaml
  - id: backlog
    kind: expr
    expr: "CLAMP(demand - SHIFT(capacity, 1), 0, +INF)"
```
This will compile into a small subgraph:
- SHIFT(capacity, 1) â†’ ShiftNode("shift_cap", capacity, 1)
- demand - shift_cap â†’ BinaryOpNode(Sub)
- CLAMP(â€¦, 0, +INF) â†’ ClampNode

The graph remains explicit and explainable.

## Execution model

FlowTime uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and topological sort:
1. Validate: detect cycles (Kahnâ€™s algorithm). Fail fast on invalid models.
2. Order: compute a topological order over nodes.
3. Evaluate: for each node in order, call Evaluate(grid, getInput) where getInput returns previously computed series.
4. Memoize: store each nodeâ€™s output once; downstream nodes reuse it.

This yields deterministic, repeatable results with no hidden state.

### Determinism and safety
- Deterministic per-bin math, culture-invariant CSV.
- Length checks ensure ConstSeriesNode values match grid.Bins.
- Missing inputs throw clear exceptions.

## Examples in practice

### Minimal Model Artifact (M2.x)
```yaml
kind: Model
schemaVersion: 1
metadata:
  title: "Hello World Flow"
  created: "2024-09-20T10:00:00Z"
spec:
  grid:
    bins: 8
    binMinutes: 60
  nodes:
    - id: demand
      kind: const
      values: [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10]
    - id: served
      kind: expr
      expr: "demand * 0.8"
  outputs:
    - series: served
      as: served.csv
```
Run (CLI):
```powershell
dotnet run --project src/FlowTime.Cli -- run examples/hello/model.yaml --out out/hello --verbose
```
Console summary (verbose):
```
FlowTime run summary:
  Grid: bins=8, binMinutes=60
  Topological order: demand -> served
  Wrote served.csv (8 rows)
```
CSV head:
```
t,value
0,8
1,8
2,8
...
```

### Series Ã— series
If you define two const nodes and an expr that references both (future parser), we compile to a BinaryOpNode with both inputs:
- a=[2,3,4], c=[5,6,7], b=a*c â†’ b=[10,18,28]

Today, you can build the same in code/tests by composing nodes directly.

## Roadmap alignment

- M0: grid + series + DAG + minimal nodes + CLI. Tiny exprs translate to BinaryOpNode with scalar RHS.
- M1: expression parser, SHIFT built-in, general references â†’ compiled nodes under the hood.
- M2+: add DELAY/RESAMPLE/CLAMP, backlog/queues/routing, API/SPA, real-time, storage providers.

## Why nodes (even with expressions)?

- Explainability: graphs make lineage explicit and reviewable.
- Testability: primitives are easy to verify independently and in composition.
- Optimization: specific nodes (e.g., Shift) can be optimized later.
- Caching: memoization at node granularity.

## Unified Model Artifact: FlowTime & FlowTime-Sim

Both FlowTime and FlowTime-Sim now use the same unified Model artifact format. The `spec` contains the model definition that both engines understand:

### Model Artifact Structure
```yaml
kind: Model
schemaVersion: 1
metadata:
  title: "Production Flow Model"
  created: "2024-09-20T10:00:00Z"
  description: "Basic demand and capacity model"
spec:
  grid:
    bins: 8
    binMinutes: 60
  nodes:
    - id: demand
      kind: const
      values: [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10]
    - id: served
      kind: expr
      expr: "demand * 0.8"
  # Optional randomness configuration (used by Sim, ignored by Engine)
  rng:
    kind: pcg32
    seed: 12345
  outputs:
    - series: served
      as: served.csv
```

### Engine Behavior Differences
- **FlowTime (Engine)**: Always deterministic - ignores `rng`/`seed` fields in `spec`
- **FlowTime-Sim**: Uses `rng`/`seed` from `spec` for reproducible synthetic data generation
- **Model Sharing**: Same Model artifact works for both engines - only execution behavior differs
- **Artifacts**: Both produce compatible output artifacts (same JSON schemas, CSV formats)

### Benefits of Unified Format
- **Single Model Definition**: No need for separate Engine vs Sim model files
- **Registry Integration**: Clear artifact identity with `kind: Model` for M2.7+ registry
- **Metadata Support**: Rich metadata for discovery, organization, and UI display
- **Future Extensions**: Easy to add tags, descriptions, version info as needed

## FAQs

- Do expressions replace nodes? Noâ€”expressions compile to nodes. Nodes remain the execution plan.
- Can I do series Ã— series operations? Yes. The node supports it; the YAML parser will cover it in M1+. For now, tests show the behavior.
- How are cycles handled? The graph rejects cycles at construction.
- How do I see what was evaluated? Use `--verbose` to print topo order and outputs.
