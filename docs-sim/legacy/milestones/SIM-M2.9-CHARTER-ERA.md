**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Planned (Charter-Aligned)  
**Dependencies:** SIM-M2.8 (Model Authoring Service & API), Engine M2.9  
**Target:** FlowTime-Sim support for Engine compare workflows and integration testing  
**Date:** 2025-09-30

## Goal

Prepare **FlowTime-Sim** to support Engine M2.9 Compare Workflow by implementing model validation, quality assurance, and Engine integration testing capabilities. This milestone ensures Sim-created models integrate seamlessly with Engine comparison and analysis workflows.

## Context & Charter Alignment

**Parallel Development**: This milestone runs parallel to Engine M2.9 Compare Workflow, ensuring Sim models are compatible with Engine comparison capabilities.

**Compare Preparation**: Establishes validation and testing infrastructure that enables:
- Model quality assessment for reliable comparisons
- Engine integration testing to ensure model compatibility
- Baseline model creation for comparison scenarios
- Quality metadata that supports comparison analysis

## Functional Requirements

### **FR-SIM-M2.9-1: API Consolidation & Legacy Cleanup**
Clean up deprecated scenarios endpoints following successful UI-M2.8 template API integration.

**Background**: UI-M2.8 successfully migrated FlowTime UI from hardcoded template generation to FlowTime-Sim `/v1/sim/templates` API integration. The legacy `/v1/sim/scenarios` endpoints are now obsolete.

**API Cleanup:**
- **Remove deprecated endpoints**: `/v1/sim/scenarios`, `/v1/sim/scenarios/categories`
- **Update test scripts**: Migrate validation scripts from scenarios to templates endpoints  
- **Documentation cleanup**: Remove scenarios references, update integration guides
- **Backward compatibility plan**: Define deprecation timeline and migration guidance

**Integration Validation:**
- **UI compatibility**: Ensure UI-M2.8 template integration remains unaffected
- **External dependencies**: Identify and migrate any remaining scenarios endpoint usage
- **API versioning**: Maintain clean v1 API surface focused on templates architecture

### **FR-SIM-M2.9-2: Model Validation & Quality Assurance**
Comprehensive validation system ensuring Sim models work reliably in Engine compare workflows.

**Validation Framework:**
- **Syntax Validation**: YAML structure, field types, required properties
- **Semantic Validation**: Node dependencies, expression validity, logical consistency  
- **Engine Compatibility**: SchemaVersion 1 compliance, supported node kinds, expression syntax
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end test execution via Engine API calls

**Quality Assessment:**
- **Completeness Score**: Configuration detail, metadata completeness, documentation quality
- **Realism Score**: Parameter values appropriate for domain, realistic constraints and ranges
- **Performance Score**: Expected Engine execution efficiency, memory usage, computation time
- **Comparison Readiness**: Model suitability for comparison scenarios and baseline usage

### **FR-SIM-M2.9-3: Engine Integration Testing**
Testing framework to validate model compatibility with Engine execution and comparison workflows.

**Integration Test Framework:**
- **Engine API Testing**: Validate model execution via Engine API endpoints
- **Comparison Compatibility**: Test models work correctly in Engine compare scenarios
- **Performance Validation**: Ensure models execute within acceptable time and resource limits
- **Error Handling**: Test graceful handling of model execution failures and edge cases

**Test Scenarios:**
- **Baseline Execution**: Verify model executes successfully and produces expected outputs
- **Comparison Baseline**: Validate model can serve as comparison baseline for other models/runs
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: Test model behavior with varied parameter values
- **Edge Case Handling**: Validate model behavior at parameter boundaries and unusual inputs

### **FR-SIM-M2.9-4: Compare Workflow Readiness**
Features that enable Sim models to participate effectively in Engine compare workflows.

**Comparison Metadata:**
- **Baseline Indicators**: Mark models as suitable for comparison baselines
- **Comparison Tags**: Categorize models for comparison grouping and filtering
- **Quality Metrics**: Provide quality scores that inform comparison reliability
- **Version Tracking**: Support model versioning for comparison evolution tracking

**Compare Integration:**
- **Model Export Preparation**: Prepare models for Engine registry integration (M3.0 preparation)
- **Comparison Documentation**: Generate model documentation supporting comparison analysis
- **Quality Reports**: Provide quality assessment reports for comparison context
- **Integration Status**: Track model readiness for Engine integration and comparison use
