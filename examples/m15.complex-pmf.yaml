# SIM-M2.1 Example: Complex multi-component PMF scenario
# Demonstrates advanced PMF usage with different distributions per component

# Note: This example shows the intended usage pattern
# Current implementation supports single component, but framework ready for multi-component
arrivals:
  kind: pmf
  values: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]          # Fibonacci-like values
  probabilities: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1]  # Skewed distribution
  # Expected value: 1*0.1 + 2*0.2 + 3*0.3 + 5*0.3 + 8*0.1 = 3.6 arrivals per bin
